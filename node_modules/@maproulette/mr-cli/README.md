# mr-cli MapRoulette Command Line Interface Utility

The mr-cli package provides a `mr` command-line utility intended to offer
various tools for working with [MapRoulette](https://maproulette.org). At the
moment, only generation of cooperative challenge GeoJSON is supported, but
additional tools and features are planned for the future.

Use `mr --help` for a list of top-level commands, and `mr <command> --help` for
usage and options available for a specific command.


## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v10.15 LTS or higher)
- [npm](http://npm.js) or yarn


## Installation
Installing globally allows you to run the `mr` command from anywhere.

```
npm install -g @maproulette/mr-cli
```

## Upgrading
Repeating the installation command will upgrade a global copy to the latest
version.

```
npm install -g @maproulette/mr-cli
```


## Creating Cooperative Challenges
Cooperative challenges associate existing, uncomitted, in-progress work with
each task. That work is then presented to MapRoulette mappers for final
completion or verification.

The `mr cooperative` command can be used to generate GeoJSON with cooperative tasks
suitable for upload to MapRoulette during creation of a new challenge. It
requires the desired type of cooperative tasks to be specified: `change` for
standard cooperative tasks with attached change files, which allows for inclusion
of unrestricted edits; or `tag` for special tag-only fixes that can be
completed and committed to OpenStreetMap fully within MapRoulette without need
for an external editor.

One or more change files -- either saved
[JOSM (.osm)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM_file_format) files or
[OSMChange (.osc)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmChange) files --
must be given as the final parameter to the `mr cooperative` command. The
files will be processed and "line-by-line GeoJSON" suitable for uploading to
MapRoulette during challenge creation will be output.

By default, the GeoJSON is written to the standard output. You can easily
specify the name of an output file instead with the `--out` parameter.

### JOSM Workflow
1. Make edits in JOSM
2. Save file -- **don't** upload to OSM. If you want multiple edits per task,
   save the work for each task into its own file
3. Use `mr cooperative` with your saved JOSM file to generate a MapRoulette challenge file
4. Create a new MapRoulette challenge and choose to upload a local file, providing the
challenge file


### Generating Cooperative Tasks with Attached Change Files
Basic Syntax:

```
mr cooperative change [--out <challenge-file>] [--bijective] <input-files..>
```

To generate a standard cooperative challenge with tasks containing unrestricted
changes represented by one or more change files (either JOSM .osm or OSMChange
.osc), use the `mr cooperative change` command. The work-in-progress changes
will be served to the mapper in their editor during task completion so that
they can finish or verify the work. Final work is then saved to OSM by the
mapper through their editor just as they would for their own edits in a normal
task.

JOSM files do not organize individual edits into groups, so, by default, each
modification found in JOSM file(s) will be represented as a single task in the
challenge file. If you wish to group multiple edits together, then save each
group of edits into its own file and use the `--bijective` option to create one
task per file.

OSMChange (.osc) files do allow individual edits to be grouped, and so all
edits in each "action" group will be represented as a single task. You can also
separate the edits into multiple files and use the `--bijective` option, just
as with JOSM files.

Sometimes elements in a change file reference other elements, but the data for
those other elements isn't included in the file. In that case `mr` will contact
OSM and fetch the referenced element data when needed.

> If your change file is based on data from the OSM dev servers, then you also
> need to add the `--dev` flag so that the OSM dev servers are contacted
> instead of the production servers

#### Example 1: turn every edit into a separate task
Assume some new benches (nodes) have been added. As each edit (node addition)
stands on its own, we can save all of these together in a single JOSM file if
desired, and will have every edit turned into a separate MapRoulette task.

We will read input data from a `new_benches.osm` JOSM file we saved and have
the outputted challenge GeoJSON saved to a file called
`new_bench_challenge.json`.

```
mr cooperative change --out new_bench_challenge.json new_benches.osm
```

#### Example 2: package multiple, related edits into each task
Now we wish to add some buildings, which will include new nodes and a way for
each building. To associate multiple edits with a single task in JOSM files,
the edits for each task must be saved together in separate files. In our
example, each building must be saved in its own file. All of these files are
then fed in together with the `--bijective` option to create a one-to-one
mapping from files to tasks in the outputted GeoJSON.

We'll assume we saved our files as `new_building_1.osm`, `new_building_2.osm`,
etc. The naming doesn't matter as long as you can easily reference all the
files -- we'll do so here using wildcards. We'll save the challenge GeoJSON to
a file called `new_buildings_challenge.json`.

```
mr cooperative change --out new_buildings_challenge.json --bijective new_buildings_*.osm
```


### Generating Cooperative Tasks with Tag-Only Fixes
Basic Syntax:

```
mr cooperative tag [--out <challenge-file>] [--dev] <input-files..>
```

If your changes consist purely of tag fixes, an alternative "tag fix" (formerly
quick fix) style cooperative challenge can be generated instead with the `mr
cooperative tag` command. MapRoulette will present the proposed tag changes to
mappers during task completion and allow them to approve or reject the changes
within MapRoulette, as well as modify the tags if needed. Approved changes are
submitted directly to OSM by MapRoulette itself, removing the need for external
editors.

One or more change files must be provided. Note that only one edit can be
represented by each tag fix cooperative task, so each modification found in the
change file(s) will be represented as a single task in the challenge file.
There is no ability to group edits for tag fix tasks, and any grouping in an
OSMChange file will be ignored.

Tag-fixes for each task are computed by comparing the proposed state in the
change file with the versions of OpenStreetMap data *referenced in the file*
(which may not necessarily be the very latest version at the time `mr` is run)
and then analyzing the differences.

> If your change file is based on data from the OSM dev servers, then you also
> need to add the `--dev` flag so that the OSM dev servers are contacted
> instead of the production servers

When the tag fix is presented to a mapper in MapRoulette, the latest OSM data
will first be fetched so that only pertinent tag changes are shown to the
mapper.


## Additional Notes
- The `mr cooperative` command usually needs to contact the OSM servers when
generating tasks and thus needs internet access to run. To play nice with OSM
servers, at most 4 network requests per second will be made.

- Generated challenge files use a
[line-by-line](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/wiki/Line-by-Line-GeoJSON-Format)
format that is well suited to streaming, whereby each line in the file contains a
complete GeoJSON object representing a single task in the challenge. It may not be
possible to open or manipulate this file using traditional GeoJSON tools

- This utility has not been tested on Windows


## Development
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to install NPM modules

Run with `npm run mr -- <command>`. If you're writing to the standard output,
use `npm --silent run ...` so that the generated GeoJSON isn't polluted with
status messages from NPM.
